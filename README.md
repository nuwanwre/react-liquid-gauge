### React-Liquid-Gauge 

Forked from [React-Liquid-Guage](https://github.com/trendmicro-frontend/react-liquid-gauge)

[DEMO](https://i.imgur.com/gb1S3bJ)

This implementation persists the wave pattern and accompanying animations, but clips the guage to a rectangular shape.

This gauge was modified for a single use case, therefore might not suit every use case. You may fork, and adjust it your own needs from parent repository or here.
